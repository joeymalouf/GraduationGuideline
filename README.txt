Graduation Guideline

Current Status:

I've created the environment. I set up the different layers and the connections between them. I started an angular project in the web layer; it currently contains sample code and a few css edits for colors I'll use later. I connected the data layer to a postgresql database and pushed my first migration creating a basic user entity with just a username and password to be edited later. Besides creating the environment and having everything setup, I haven't gotten much done on the actual project.

Progress Made:
I went from having nothing to having a working environment I can begin coding in. This was probably the most frustrating part of the process. Github doesn't really show it because I don't like to push broken code, but I went through a lot of debugging to get my code in a running state. 

Problems Encountered:
I originally wanted to use MySQL. The newer versions of dotnet core don't play well with it in my hands. After a few hours of reaching errors that were in parts of code not in my control, I gave up and restarted the data layer. I used postgresql on the restart and wasted much less time.
I originally wanted to use Ole Miss's CSS for my project. I realize now that it makes much more sense to just use their colors and some of their layout ideas rather than dig through their CSS for what I do and don't need.

Report 2

Current Status:
I created some of the navigation and started laying out the pages to be used. I edited some CSS in old files, the navigation menu, to better fit the theme. I added a package to use for PDF creation. I followed a guide to set up PDF creation ad made a test file that returned a new PDF. I began work on creating the forms I need.

Progress Made:
At this point pretty much all the tools I need (besides user authentication) are set up. Most of the coding from here should be straight forward and not fiddling with making new packages work in the project.

Problems Encountered:
I'm not super familiar with Angular project files and setup, so I first had to learn how to setup new pages to get them to load. I realized by initial plan for navigation, dropdown within a dropdown, is unfriendly for mobile and had to come up with a new design.
