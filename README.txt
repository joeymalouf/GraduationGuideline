Graduation Guideline

Current Status:

I've created the environment. I set up the different layers and the connections between them. I started an angular project in the web layer; it currently contains sample code and a few css edits for colors I'll use later. I connected the data layer to a postgresql database and pushed my first migration creating a basic user entity with just a username and password to be edited later. Besides creating the environment and having everything setup, I haven't gotten much done on the actual project.

Progress Made:
I went from having nothing to having a working environment I can begin coding in. This was probably the most frustrating part of the process. Github doesn't really show it because I don't like to push broken code, but I went through a lot of debugging to get my code in a running state. 

Problems Encountered:
I originally wanted to use MySQL. The newer versions of dotnet core don't play well with it in my hands. After a few hours of reaching errors that were in parts of code not in my control, I gave up and restarted the data layer. I used postgresql on the restart and wasted much less time.
I originally wanted to use Ole Miss's CSS for my project. I realize now that it makes much more sense to just use their colors and some of their layout ideas rather than dig through their CSS for what I do and don't need.
