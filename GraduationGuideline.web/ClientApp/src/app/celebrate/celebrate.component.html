            If you have completed all previous steps and have successfully passed all required courses (e.g., can pass
            a degree audit for your program)
            during your final semester, then you will be certified by the Graduate School and Registrarâ€™s Office for
            graduation. You may officially graduate at the end of a December,
            May or August semester. A commencement ceremony, including a doctoral hooding ceremony for doctoral
            graduates, is held only in May.
            The process of mailing diplomas will begin approximately 8 weeks after each graduation date.
            If you wish to participate in a commencement and/or hooding ceremony, you will need to rent regalia.
